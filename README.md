# Hi!!!

Who is this, you might ask? Well, I am **Albin**/**Sotpotatis**/**Sweet potato**/**SÃ¶tpotatis**/*a bunch of other names too*

As far as technology goes: I shape the future! Born 2004, and speaks Python, MicroPython, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Ruby (workin' on it at least ðŸ˜Ž), Dart (soon), your favorite frameworks and libraries: Bootstrap, jQuery, Tailwind, Kivy, Matplotlib, Flask (to name a few), and general computer/electronics stuff: ESP32/ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, Apache, soldering. I am also very keen on home automation and is experienced with Home Assistant and NodeRed as well as some tinkering around with ESPHome. I speak your favorite hardware and microcontrollers: PyCom, Raspberry Pi, D1 Mini, DigiSpark, etc.

I am mostly experienced with Python and have done a lot in the language, from web apps to tray applications to tinkering on small ESP32s.

I have also built my own server computer. The computer part picking site automatically named my build "Dysfunctional Collie", although it works very well, so I call it simply "Collie", or "Albins Collie".
