My name is Albin Seijmer. This is my GitHub, home to some of my programming projects. I'm 17 (soon 18) when I write this, but I'm born in January 2004, so do the math yourself :D

I know multiple programming and markup languages, including Python, Javascript, C#, HTML, CSS, etc. I also know a lot about microcontrollers, embedded sensors, and I can and have built and tinkered around with computers in various form factors. I know PCB design, 3D modelling, and server deployment.
I love APIs, both making and interacting with them. And, I do both backend and frontend development.
